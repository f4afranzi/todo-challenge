# todo-challenge-backend

## Background:
I am a test automation engineer (with no coding background) I was a manual QA and developed to a testautomation Engineer for mobile apps over the years.
But this is not all! I want to be able to contribute to our development work. I already learned some things lot but now i need to put it all together to.

My wonderful team at work is very supportive and i got the challenge and the time to create a ToDo-App. I need to write the backend and the Android App by myself (with help of course).

I am crazy excited and this is step number one.

### Build a backend:

- with Spring and Kotlin
- build the typical things we need: create, read, update and delete tasks
