# todo-challenge-backend

## Background:
I am a test automation engineer (with no coding background) I was a manual QA and developed to a testautomation Engineer for mobile apps over the years.
I already learned some things lot but now i need to put it all together.

My wonderful team at work is very supportive and i got the challenge and the time to create a ToDo-App. I need to write the backend and the Android App with help by myself.

I am crazy excited and this is step number one.
